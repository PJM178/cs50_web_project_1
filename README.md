# CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript - Project 1

This is a repository for project 1 of CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. The goal of the project was to build a functionally wikipedia inspired website using Django. The website consists of the following components:
* Entry page - If a link exists, the user is taken to the page but otherwise an error is displayed.
* Index page - Displays all the entries in the wiki.
* Search - Takes the user to the searched entry, otherwise displays all the results containing the inputted symbols as substrings.
* New page - Allows the user to create a page if the page doesn't already exist in which case an error page is displayed.
* Edit page - Allows the user to edit existing entries' content after which the user is redirected to the new entry.
* Random page - Displays a random page from the wiki entries.
